I made this program to help me keep track of my spending during work trips.

It takes the following inputs:
- CSV file of credit card transactions with the format (Transaction Date, Transaction Description, Transaction Amount)
- State that the job is located in.
- City that the job is located in.

The report that is generated prints out the following information:
- Duration of the trip in days
- Total of the credit card charges
- Total per diem earned during the trip
- The net gain/loss

The per diem rates are determined by the most recent rates at [GSA Per Diem Rates](https://www.gsa.gov/node/86696/per-diem-files#Per-diem-rates).
